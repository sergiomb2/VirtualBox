# Oracle VirtualBox

VirtualBox is a general-purpose full virtualization software for x86_64
hardware (with version 7.1 additionally for macOS/Arm), targeted at laptop,
desktop, server and embedded use.

It features a very user friendly graphical user interface and is available for
many popular operating systems (Linux, Windows, macOS and Solaris). Flexible
networking setup and interactive performance are the strong points.

Anyone with the need to run multiple operating systems simultaneously with some
basic knowledge about PCs and operating system installation can use it to
reduce effort with a large number of tasks including software testing.

## Getting started

VirtualBox is a complex product with multiple dependencies, some of them
specific to the operating system on which you want to run it.

The basics for building VirtualBox are described on the [build
instructions](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Build_instructions) page. 

## Documentation

The [VirtualBox User
Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/virtualization/virtualbox/index.html)
contains all information relevant for users, including the product features and
their configuration.

For developers it is recommended to start with the [technical
documentation](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Technical_documentation) which
contains links to a broad collection of pages related to development, covering
many aspects of the project and its features.
