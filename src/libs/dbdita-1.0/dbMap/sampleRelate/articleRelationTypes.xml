<title>Relationship types</title>
<para>A content object can have two basic types of relationships
within a DITA map:</para>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>Navigation relationships</term>
<listitem>
<para>Such relationships to content objects that are nearby
in the navigation hierarchy include parent, previous, next,
and child relationships.  A content object that appears 
in more than one position within the hierarchy can have
different relationships in different contexts.  Nearby 
content often contributes to a larger composite content
object. 
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Related content</term>
<listitem>
<para>Such relationships can cut across the navigation hierarchy
and, in some respects, resemble a see-also relationship 
in an index.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
