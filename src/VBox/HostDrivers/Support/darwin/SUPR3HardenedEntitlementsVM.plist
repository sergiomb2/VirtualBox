      The following two entitlements are required for using AppleHV on Catalina.
      The first entitlement allows us to have unsigned executable memory in the guests
      address space like the BIOS code (and essentially all the guests address space which
      is mapped as RWX).
      The second entitlement is required in order to map guest memory as RWX into the
      guests address space.
      These entitlements are not required starting with BigSur+ where Apple has clearly
      changed something in their entitlement scheme without properly documenting it.
