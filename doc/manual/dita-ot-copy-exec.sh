# Helper Script for copying the DITA-OT toolkit from $1 to $2,
# run the following command line, nuke $2.
#
# DITA-OT-1.8.5 updates around 40 files everytime it is started in an manner
# that will cause race conditions when starting multiple dost.jar instances
# concurrently.  So, we work around that by running each job of a unqiue and
# temporary copy.  Extra effort is taken to using hardlinking when possible
# and to reduce the number of files and directory we copy.
