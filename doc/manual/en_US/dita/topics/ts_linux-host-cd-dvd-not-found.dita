  <title>Linux Host CD/DVD or Floppy Disk Drive Not Found</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>
        If you have configured a virtual machine to use the host's CD or
        DVD drive or floppy disk drive, but this does not appear to
        work, make sure that the current user has permission to access
        the corresponding Linux device file. For example, for a CD or
        DVD drive this may be <filepath>/dev/hdc</filepath>,
        <filepath>/dev/scd0</filepath>, <filepath>/dev/cdrom</filepath>
        or similar. On most distributions, the user must be added to a
        corresponding group, usually called <userinput>cdrom</userinput> or
        <userinput>cdrw</userinput> or <userinput>floppy</userinput>.
      </p>
    <p>
        On supported Linux distributions, Oracle VM VirtualBox uses
        <userinput>udev</userinput> to locate hardware such as CD/DVD drives
        and floppy disk drives.
