  <title>Drag'n Drop not Working</title>
  
  <body>     
    <p>
      Microsoft Windows uses technologies like UAC (User Account Control) and
      UIPI (User Interface Privilege Isolation) to prevent and/or mitigate
      security issues. By default, UAC and UIPI are enabled.
    </p>
    <p>
      When an Oracle VM VirtualBox VM process is running with a higher so-called
      privilege level than another process that wants to interact with the
      VM process via drag'n drop (or system clipboard), Windows prevents this
      by default due to security reasons. This results in Oracle VM VirtualBox not
      being able to receive any Windows messages for drag'n drop. To make this work, 
      the Oracle VM VirtualBox VM process must be running with
      the same (or lower) privilege level as the process it is interacting with
      using drag'n drop.</p>
      
      <p>Disabling UAC and/or UIPI is not recommended.
