  <title>Running Your Virtual Machine</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>
      To start a virtual machine, you have the following options:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Double-click on the VM's entry in the machine list in
          VirtualBox Manager.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Select the VM's entry in the machine list in VirtualBox Manager, and
          click <b outputclass="bold">Start</b> in the toolbar
          the top of the window.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Go to the <filepath>VirtualBox VMs</filepath> folder in your
          system user's home directory. Find the subdirectory of the
          machine you want to start and double-click on the machine
          settings file. This file has a <filepath>.vbox</filepath> file
          extension.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Starting a virtual machine displays a new window, and the virtual
      machine which you selected will boot up. Everything which would
      normally be seen on the virtual system's monitor is shown in the
      window. See <xref href="Introduction.dita#Introduction/fig-win2016-intro"/>.

      In general, you can use the virtual machine as you would use a
      real computer. The following topics describe a few points to note
      when running a VM.
