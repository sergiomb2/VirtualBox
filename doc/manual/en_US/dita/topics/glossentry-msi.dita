        Message Signaled Interrupts, as supported by modern chipsets such as 
        the ICH9. See <xref href="settings-motherboard.dita"/>. As opposed to traditional 
        pin-based interrupts, with MSI, a small amount of data can accompany 
        the actual interrupt message. This reduces the amount of hardware pins 
        required and allows for more interrupts and better performance.
