  <title>No Networking in Windows Vista Guests</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>
        With Windows Vista, Microsoft dropped support for the AMD PCNet
        card that legacy versions of Oracle VM VirtualBox used to provide as
        the default virtual network card. For Windows Vista guests,
        Oracle VM VirtualBox now uses an Intel E1000 card by default.

        If, for some reason, you still want to use the AMD card, you
        need to download the PCNet driver from the AMD website. This
        driver is available for 32-bit Windows only. You can transfer it
        into the virtual machine using a shared folder. See
        <xref href="sharedfolders.dita">Shared Folders</xref>.
