        One property of virtual machine monitors (VMMs) like
        Oracle VM VirtualBox is to encapsulate a guest by executing it in a
        protected environment, a virtual machine, running as a user
        process on the host operating system. The guest cannot
        communicate directly with the hardware or other computers but
        only through the VMM. The VMM provides emulated physical
        resources and devices to the guest which are accessed by the
        guest operating system to perform the required tasks. The VM
        settings control the resources provided to the guest, for
        example the amount of guest memory or the number of guest
        processors and the enabled features for that guest. For example
        remote control, certain screen settings and others. See
