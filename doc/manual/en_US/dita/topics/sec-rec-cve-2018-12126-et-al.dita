        These security issues affect a range of Intel CPUs starting with
        Nehalem. The CVE-2018-12130 also affects some Atom Silvermont,
        Atom Airmont, and Knights family CPUs, however the scope is so
        limited that the host OS should deal with it and Oracle VM VirtualBox
        is therefore not affected. Leaks only happens when entering and
        leaving C states.
