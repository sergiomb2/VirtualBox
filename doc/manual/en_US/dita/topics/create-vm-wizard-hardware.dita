        The following fields are available on this wizard page:
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">Base Memory.</b> Select the
            amount of RAM that Oracle VM VirtualBox should allocate every time
            the virtual machine is started. The amount of memory
            selected here will be taken away from your host machine and
            presented to the guest OS, which will report this size as
            the virtual machines installed RAM.
          </p>
        <note type="caution">
          <p>
              Choose this setting carefully. The memory you give to the
              VM will not be available to your host OS while the VM is
              running, so do not specify more than you can spare.
            </p>
          <p>
              For example, if your host machine has 4 GB of RAM and you
              enter 2048 MB as the amount of RAM for a particular
              virtual machine, you will only have 2 GB left for all the
              other software on your host while the VM is running. If
              you run two VMs at the same time, even more memory will be
              allocated for the second VM, which may not even be able to
              start if that memory is not available.
            </p>
          <p>
              On the other hand, you should specify as much as your
              guest OS and your applications will require to run
              properly. A guest OS may require at least 1 or 2 GB of
              memory to install and boot up. For best performance, more
              memory than that may be required.
            </p>
        </note>
        <p>
            Always ensure that the host OS has enough RAM remaining. If
            insufficient RAM remains, the system might excessively swap
            memory to the hard disk, which effectively brings the host
            system to a standstill.
          </p>
        <p>
            As with other <b outputclass="bold">Create Virtual
            Machine</b> wizard settings, you can change this
            setting later, after you have created the VM.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">Processor(s).</b> Select the
            number of virtual processors to assign to the VM.
          </p>
        <p>
            It is not advised to assign more than half of the total
            processor threads from the host machine.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">Enable EFI.</b> Enables
            Extensible Firware Interface (EFI) booting for the guest OS.
          </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
