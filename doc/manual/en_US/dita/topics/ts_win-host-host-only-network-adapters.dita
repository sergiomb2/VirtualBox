  <title>Host-Only Networking Adapters Cannot be Created</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>
        If a host-only adapter cannot be created, either with the
        VirtualBox Manager or the <userinput>VBoxManage</userinput> command, then
        the INF cache is probably corrupt. In this case, the install log
        at <filepath>%windir%\inf\setupapi.dev.log</filepath> would
        typically mention the failure to find a suitable driver package
        for the <filepath>sun_VBoxNetAdp</filepath> component. Again, as
        with the bridged networking problem described above, the
        solution is to uninstall Oracle VM VirtualBox, remove the INF cache
        (<filepath>%windir%\inf\INFCACHE.1</filepath>), reboot and try
        to reinstall Oracle VM VirtualBox.
