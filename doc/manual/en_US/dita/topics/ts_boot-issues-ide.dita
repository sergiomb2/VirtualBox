    <title>Guest OSs With no ATAPI CD-ROM Support May Fail to Boot</title>
    <body>
        <p>Some guest operating systems predating ATAPI CD-ROMs may exhibit long delays or entirely fail to boot in certain configurations. This is most likely to happen when an IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM exists alone on a primary or secondary IDE channel. For example, OS/2 1.21 fails to boot with an error message referencing COUNTRY.SYS, and OS/2 1.3 experiences long boot delays.</p>
        <p>Disable the emulated IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM. The guest OS can't use this device anyway.</p>
