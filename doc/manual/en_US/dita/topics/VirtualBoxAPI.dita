  <title>Oracle VM VirtualBox Programming Interfaces</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>
    Oracle VM VirtualBox comes with comprehensive support for third-party
    developers. The so-called <i>Main API</i> of
    Oracle VM VirtualBox exposes the entire feature set of the virtualization
    engine. It is completely documented and available to anyone who
    wishes to control Oracle VM VirtualBox programmatically.
  </p>
    <p>
    The Main API is made available to C++ clients through COM on Windows
    hosts or XPCOM on other hosts. Bridges also exist for SOAP, Java and
    Python.
  </p>
    <p>
    All programming information such as documentation, reference
    information, header and other interface files, as well as samples
    have been split out to a separate <b outputclass="bold">Software
    Development Kit (SDK)</b>. The SDK is available for download
    from
    <ph>http://www.virtualbox.org</ph>.
    In particular, the SDK comes with a Programming Guide and Reference
    manual in PDF format. This manual contains, among other things, the
    information that was previously in this chapter of the User Manual.
