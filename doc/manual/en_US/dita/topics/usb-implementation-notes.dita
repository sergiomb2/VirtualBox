        On Windows hosts, a kernel mode device driver provides USB proxy
        support. It implements both a USB monitor, which enables
        Oracle VM VirtualBox to capture devices when they are plugged in, and
        a USB device driver to claim USB devices for a particular
        virtual machine. System reboots are not necessary after
        installing the driver. Also, you do not need to replug devices
        for Oracle VM VirtualBox to claim them.
      </p>
                  <p>
        On supported Linux hosts, Oracle VM VirtualBox accesses USB devices
        through special files in the file system. When Oracle VM VirtualBox is
        installed, these are made available to all users in the
        <codeph>vboxusers</codeph> system group. In order to be able
        to access USB from guest systems, make sure that you are a
        member of this group.
