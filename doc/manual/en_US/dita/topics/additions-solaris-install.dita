  <title>Installing the Oracle Solaris Guest Additions</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>
          The Oracle VM VirtualBox Guest Additions for Oracle Solaris are
          provided on the same ISO CD-ROM as the Additions for Windows
          and Linux. They come with an installation program that guides
          you through the setup process.
        </p>
    <p>
          Installation involves the following steps:
        </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
              Mount the <filepath>VBoxGuestAdditions.iso</filepath> file
              as your Oracle Solaris guest's virtual CD-ROM drive,
              exactly the same way as described for a Windows guest in
              <xref href="mountingadditionsiso.dita#mountingadditionsiso"/>.
            </p>
        <p>
              If the CD-ROM drive on the guest does not get mounted, as
              seen with some versions of Oracle Solaris 10, run the
              following command as root:
            </p>
        <pre xml:space="preserve">svcadm restart volfs</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
              Change to the directory where your CD-ROM drive is mounted
              and run the following command as root:
            </p>
        <pre xml:space="preserve">pkgadd -G -d ./VBoxSolarisAdditions.pkg</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
              Choose <b outputclass="bold">1</b> and confirm
              installation of the Guest Additions package. After the
              installation is complete, log out and log in to X server
              on your guest, to activate the X11 Guest Additions.
            </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
