  <title>CD and DVD Changes Not Recognized</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>
        In case you have assigned a physical CD or DVD drive to a guest
        and the guest does not notice when the medium changes, make sure
        that the Windows media change notification (MCN) feature is not
        turned off. This is represented by the following key in the
        Windows registry:
      </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Cdrom\Autorun</pre>
    <p>
        Certain applications may disable this key against Microsoft's
        advice. If it is set to 0, change it to 1 and reboot your
        system. Oracle VM VirtualBox relies on Windows notifying it of media
        changes.
