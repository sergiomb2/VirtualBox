    <p>
        Linux kernels including the grsec patch, see
        <ph>http://www.grsecurity.net/</ph>, and derivates have
        to disable PAX_MPROTECT for the <userinput>VBox</userinput> binaries
        to be able to start a VM. The reason is that Oracle VM VirtualBox has
        to create executable code on anonymous memory.
