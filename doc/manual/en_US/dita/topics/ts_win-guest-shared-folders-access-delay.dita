  <title>Long Delays When Accessing Shared Folders</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>
        The performance for accesses to shared folders from a Windows
        guest might be decreased due to delays during the resolution of
        the Oracle VM VirtualBox shared folders name service. To fix these
        delays, add the following entries to the file
        <filepath>\windows\system32\drivers\etc\lmhosts</filepath> of
        the Windows guest:
      </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">255.255.255.255        VBOXSVR #PRE
255.255.255.255        VBOXSRV #PRE</pre>
    <p>
        After doing this change, a reboot of the guest is required.
