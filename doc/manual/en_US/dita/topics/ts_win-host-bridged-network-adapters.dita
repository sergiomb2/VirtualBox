  <title>Bridged Networking Adapters Missing</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>
        If no bridged adapters show up in the
        <b outputclass="bold">Networking</b> section of the VM
        settings, this typically means that the bridged networking
        driver was not installed properly on your host. This could be
        due to the following reasons:
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
            The maximum allowed filter count was reached on the host. In
            this case, the MSI log would mention the
            <codeph>0x8004a029</codeph> error code returned on NetFlt
            network component install, as follows:
          </p>
        <pre xml:space="preserve">VBoxNetCfgWinInstallComponent: Install failed, hr (0x8004a029)</pre>
        <p>
            You can try to increase the maximum filter count in the
            Windows registry using the following key:
          </p>
        <pre xml:space="preserve">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Network\MaxNumFilters</pre>
        <p>
            The maximum number allowed is 14. After a reboot, try to
            reinstall Oracle VM VirtualBox.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
            The INF cache is corrupt. In this case, the install log at
            <filepath>%windir%\inf\setupapi.dev.log</filepath> would
            typically mention the failure to find a suitable driver
            package for either the <userinput>sun_VBoxNetFlt</userinput> or
            <userinput>sun_VBoxNetFltmp</userinput> components. The solution
            then is to uninstall Oracle VM VirtualBox, remove the INF cache
            (<filepath>%windir%\inf\INFCACHE.1</filepath>), reboot and
            try to reinstall Oracle VM VirtualBox.
          </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
