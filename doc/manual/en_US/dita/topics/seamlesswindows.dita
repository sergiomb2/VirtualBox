      With the <i>seamless windows</i> feature of
      Oracle VM VirtualBox, you can have the windows that are displayed within
      a virtual machine appear side by side next to the windows of your
      host. This feature is supported for the following guest operating
      systems, provided that the Guest Additions are installed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Windows guests.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Supported Linux or Oracle Solaris guests running the X Window
          System.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      After seamless windows are enabled, Oracle VM VirtualBox suppresses the
      display of the desktop background of your guest, allowing you to
      run the windows of your guest operating system seamlessly next to
      the windows of your host.

    <p>
      To enable seamless mode, after starting the virtual machine, press
      the <b outputclass="bold">Host key + L</b>. The Host key is
      normally the right control key. This will enlarge the size of the
      VM's display to the size of your host screen and mask out the
      guest operating system's background. To disable seamless windows
      and go back to the normal VM display, press the Host key + L
      again.
