      Oracle VM VirtualBox provides a <i>soft keyboard</i> that
      enables you to input keyboard characters on the guest. A soft
      keyboard is an on-screen keyboard that can be used as an
      alternative to a physical keyboard. See
      <xref href="soft-keyb-using.dita#soft-keyb-using"/> for details of how to use the
      soft keyboard.
    </p>
               <note type="caution">
                  <p>
        For best results, ensure that the keyboard layout configured on
        the guest OS matches the keyboard layout used by the soft
        keyboard. Oracle VM VirtualBox does not do this automatically.

      The soft keyboard can be used in the following scenarios:
    </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <p>
          When the physical keyboard on the host is not the same as the
          keyboard layout configured on the guest. For example, if the
          guest is configured to use an international keyboard, but the
          host keyboard is US English.
        </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>
          To send special key combinations to the guest. Note that some
          common key combinations are also available in the
          <b outputclass="bold">Input</b>,
          <b outputclass="bold">Keyboard</b> menu of the guest VM
          window. See <xref href="specialcharacters.dita#specialcharacters"/>.
        </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>
          For guests in kiosk mode, where a physical keyboard is not
          present.
        </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>
          When using nested virtualization, the soft keyboard provides a
          method of sending key presses to a guest.
        </p>
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>
      By default, the soft keyboard includes some common international
      keyboard layouts. You can copy and modify these to meet your own
      requirements. See <xref href="soft-keyb-custom.dita#soft-keyb-custom"/>.
