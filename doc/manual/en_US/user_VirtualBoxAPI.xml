  <para>
    &product-name; comes with comprehensive support for third-party
    developers. The so-called <emphasis>Main API</emphasis> of
    &product-name; exposes the entire feature set of the virtualization
    engine. It is completely documented and available to anyone who
    wishes to control &product-name; programmatically.
  </para>

  <para>
    The Main API is made available to C++ clients through COM on Windows
    hosts or XPCOM on other hosts. Bridges also exist for SOAP, Java and
    Python.
  </para>

  <para>
    All programming information such as documentation, reference
    information, header and other interface files, as well as samples
    have been split out to a separate <emphasis role="bold">Software
    Development Kit (SDK)</emphasis>. The SDK is available for download
    from
    <ulink url="http://www.virtualbox.org" />.
    In particular, the SDK comes with a Programming Guide and Reference
    manual in PDF format. This manual contains, among other things, the
    information that was previously in this chapter of the User Manual.
