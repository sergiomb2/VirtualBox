        the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program
        whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software
        Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public
        License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
      </para>

      <para>
        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
        price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure
        that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software
        (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive
        source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
        the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that
        you know you can do these things.
      </para>

      <para>
        To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
        anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
        rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
        for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you
        modify it.
      </para>

      <para>
        For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
        gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
        that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can
        get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
        know their rights.
      </para>

      <para>
        We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the
        software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
        permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
      </para>

      <para>
        Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
        certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for
        this free software. If the software is modified by someone else
        and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they
        have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
        others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
      </para>

      <para>
        Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
        patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a
        free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect
        making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it
        clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use
        or not licensed at all.
      </para>

        The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
        modification follow.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
        DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
      </para>

      <para>
        0. This License applies to any program or other work which
        contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may
        be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.
        The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a
        "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
        derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
        containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or
        with modifications and/or translated into another language.
        (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the
        term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
      </para>

      <para>
        Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
        not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act
        of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from
        the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work
        based on the Program (independent of having been made by running
        the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program
        does.
      </para>

      <para>
        1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
        source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
        conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
        appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
        intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
        absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
        Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
      </para>

      <para>
        You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
        copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
        exchange for a fee.
      </para>

      <para>
        2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
        portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and
        copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms
        of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
        conditions:
      </para>

      <para>
        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
      </para>

      <para>
        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
        in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or
        any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all
        third parties under the terms of this License.
      </para>

      <para>
        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
        notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
        provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program
        under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
        of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is
        interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,
        your work based on the Program is not required to print an
        announcement.)
      </para>

      <para>
        These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
        identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
        Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and
        separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
        do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
        separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as
        part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the
        distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,
        whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
        whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
        it.
      </para>

      <para>
        Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
        contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
        intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
        derivative or collective works based on the Program.
      </para>

      <para>
        In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
        Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program)
        on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
        the other work under the scope of this License.
      </para>

      <para>
        3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on
        it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the
        terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of
        the following:
      </para>

      <para>
        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
        Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
        interchange; or,
      </para>

      <para>
        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
        cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
        medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
      </para>

      <para>
        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the
        offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative
        is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
        received the program in object code or executable form with such
        an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
      </para>

      <para>
        The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work
        for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete
        source code means all the source code for all modules it
        contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus
        the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
        executable. However, as a special exception, the source code
        distributed need not include anything that is normally
        distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
        components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
        on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
        accompanies the executable.
      </para>

      <para>
        If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
        access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
        access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
        distribution of the source code, even though third parties are
        not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
      </para>

      <para>
        4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
        Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any
        attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
        Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
        under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
        or rights, from you under this License will not have their
        licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
        compliance.
      </para>

      <para>
        5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have
        not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to
        modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These
        actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
        Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
        based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
        License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
        distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
      </para>

      <para>
        6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on
        the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license
        from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the
        Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not
        impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of
        the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
        compliance by third parties to this License.
      </para>

      <para>
        7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
        patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to
        patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court
        order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of
        this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
        License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
        simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
        pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
        distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license
        would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
        all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
        then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License
        would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
      </para>

      <para>
        If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
        under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
        intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to
        apply in other circumstances.
      </para>

      <para>
        It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
        any patents or other property right claims or to contest
        validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose
        of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution
        system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many
        people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
        software distributed through that system in reliance on
        consistent application of that system; it is up to the
        author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
        software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose
        that choice.
      </para>

      <para>
        This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
        believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
      </para>

      <para>
        8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted
        in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
        interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program
        under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution
        limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
        permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
        case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in
        the body of this License.
      </para>

      <para>
        9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
        versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such
        new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
        but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
      </para>

      <para>
        Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
        Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
        to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
        the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
        version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
        Program does not specify a version number of this License, you
        may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
        Foundation.
      </para>

      <para>
        10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
        free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write
        to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
        copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
        Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
        decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
        status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting
        the sharing and reuse of software generally.
      </para>

      <para>
        NO WARRANTY
      </para>

      <para>
        11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
        WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
        LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
        HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
        WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
        BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
        AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
        QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
        PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
        SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
      </para>

      <para>
        12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO
        IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
        MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
        LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
        INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
        INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS
        OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
        YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH
        ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
        ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

        Preamble
      </para>

      <para>
        The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
        freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General
        Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share
        and change free software--to make sure the software is free for
        all its users.
      </para>

      <para>
        This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
        specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of
        the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use
        it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully
        about whether this license or the ordinary General Public
        License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,
        based on the explanations below.
      </para>

      <para>
        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of
        use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make
        sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free
        software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you
        receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can
        change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs;
        and that you are informed that you can do these things.
      </para>

      <para>
        To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
        distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
        these rights. These restrictions translate to certain
        responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library
        or if you modify it.
      </para>

      <para>
        For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether
        gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
        that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or
        can get the source code. If you link other code with the
        library, you must provide complete object files to the
        recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after
        making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must
        show them these terms so they know their rights.
      </para>

      <para>
        We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright
        the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you
        legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
      </para>

      <para>
        To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
        there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library
        is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should
        know that what they have is not the original version, so that
        the original author's reputation will not be affected by
        problems that might be introduced by others.
      </para>

      <para>
        Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the
        existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a
        company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program
        by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.
        Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a
        version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom
        of use specified in this license.
      </para>

      <para>
        Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
        ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU
        Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated
        libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General
        Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in
        order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.
      </para>

      <para>
        When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or
        using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally
        speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.
        The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such
        linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of
        freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax
        criteria for linking other code with the library.
      </para>

      <para>
        We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because
        it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary
        General Public License. It also provides other free software
        developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free
        programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary
        General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser
        license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.
      </para>

      <para>
        For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
        encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that
        it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free
        programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent
        case is that a free library does the same job as widely used
        non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by
        limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the
        Lesser General Public License.
      </para>

      <para>
        In other cases, permission to use a particular library in
        non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a
        large body of free software. For example, permission to use the
        GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to
        use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the
        GNU/Linux operating system.
      </para>

      <para>
        Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of
        the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program
        that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the
        wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the
        Library.
      </para>

      <para>
        The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
        modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference
        between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the
        library". The former contains code derived from the library,
        whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to
        run.

        GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR
        COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
      </para>

      <para>
        0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or
        other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright
        holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed
        under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also
        called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".
      </para>

      <para>
        A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
        prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application
        programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form
        executables.
      </para>

      <para>
        The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or
        work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based
        on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work
        under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
        Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
        modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another
        language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without
        limitation in the term "modification".)
      </para>

      <para>
        "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
        for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source
        code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus
        any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used
        to control compilation and installation of the library.
      </para>

      <para>
        Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
        not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act
        of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and
        output from such a program is covered only if its contents
        constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use
        of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true
        depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses
        the Library does.
      </para>

      <para>
        1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
        complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided
        that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
        appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
        intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
        absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License
        along with the Library.
      </para>

      <para>
        You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
        copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
        exchange for a fee.
      </para>

      <para>
        2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any
        portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and
        copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms
        of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
        conditions:
      </para>

      <para>
        a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
      </para>

      <para>
        b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
      </para>

      <para>
        c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
        charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
      </para>

      <para>
        d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or
        a table of data to be supplied by an application program that
        uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the
        facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to
        ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such
        function or table, the facility still operates, and performs
        whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
      </para>

      <para>
        (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots
        has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
        application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
        application-supplied function or table used by this function
        must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the
        square root function must still compute square roots.)
      </para>

      <para>
        These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
        identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
        Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and
        separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
        do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
        separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as
        part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the
        distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,
        whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
        whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
        it.
      </para>

      <para>
        Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
        contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
        intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
        derivative or collective works based on the Library.
      </para>

      <para>
        In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
        Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library)
        on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
        the other work under the scope of this License.
      </para>

      <para>
        3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General
        Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the
        Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer
        to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General
        Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a
        newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public
        License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead
        if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.
      </para>

      <para>
        Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
        that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to
        all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
      </para>

      <para>
        This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
        the Library into a program that is not a library.
      </para>

      <para>
        4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
        derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable
        form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you
        accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
        Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
        interchange.
      </para>

      <para>
        If distribution of object code is made by offering access to
        copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to
        copy the source code from the same place satisfies the
        requirement to distribute the source code, even though third
        parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
        object code.
      </para>

      <para>
        5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
        Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being
        compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the
        Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of
        the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
        License.
      </para>

      <para>
        However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
        creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library
        (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a
        "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore
        covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution
        of such executables.
      </para>

      <para>
        When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header
        file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work
        may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source
        code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if
        the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is
        itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not
        precisely defined by law.
      </para>

      <para>
        If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
        structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small
        inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of
        the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is
        legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object
        code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section
        6.) Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you
        may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of
        Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under
        Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the
        Library itself.
      </para>

      <para>
        6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine
        or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to
        produce a work containing portions of the Library, and
        distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that
        the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own
        use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.
      </para>

      <para>
        You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that
        the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
        covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License.
        If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you
        must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as
        well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this
        License. Also, you must do one of these things:
      </para>

      <para>
        a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
        machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
        changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
        Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable
        linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable
        "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code,
        so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to
        produce a modified executable containing the modified Library.
        (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of
        definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to
        recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)
      </para>

      <para>
        b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
        Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
        copy of the library already present on the user's computer
        system, rather than copying library functions into the
        executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
        version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the
        modified version is interface-compatible with the version that
        the work was made with.
      </para>

      <para>
        c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
        three years, to give the same user the materials specified in
        Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
        performing this distribution.
      </para>

      <para>
        d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to
        copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy
        the above specified materials from the same place.
      </para>

      <para>
        e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
        materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
      </para>

      <para>
        For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
        Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
        reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special
        exception, the materials to be distributed need not include
        anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
        binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so
        on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless
        that component itself accompanies the executable.
      </para>

      <para>
        It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
        restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
        accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you
        cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable
        that you distribute.
      </para>

      <para>
        7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
        Library side-by-side in a single library together with other
        library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute
        such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution
        of the work based on the Library and of the other library
        facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do
        these two things:
      </para>

      <para>
        a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
        based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
        facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
        Sections above.
      </para>

      <para>
        b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
        that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
        where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
      </para>

      <para>
        8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
        distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this
        License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link
        with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically
        terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who
        have received copies, or rights, from you under this License
        will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
        remain in full compliance.
      </para>

      <para>
        9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have
        not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to
        modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These
        actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
        Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work
        based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this
        License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
        distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.
      </para>

      <para>
        10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on
        the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license
        from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or
        modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You
        may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
        exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible
        for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
      </para>

      <para>
        11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
        patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to
        patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court
        order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of
        this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
        License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
        simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
        pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
        distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license
        would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
        all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
        then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License
        would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
      </para>

      <para>
        If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
        under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
        intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to
        apply in other circumstances.
      </para>

      <para>
        It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
        any patents or other property right claims or to contest
        validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose
        of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution
        system which is implemented by public license practices. Many
        people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
        software distributed through that system in reliance on
        consistent application of that system; it is up to the
        author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
        software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose
        that choice.
      </para>

      <para>
        This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
        believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
      </para>

      <para>
        12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted
        in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
        interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library
        under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution
        limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
        permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
        case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in
        the body of this License.
      </para>

      <para>
        13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
        versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
        Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
        version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
        concerns.
      </para>

      <para>
        Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
        Library specifies a version number of this License which applies
        to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
        the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
        version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
        Library does not specify a license version number, you may
        choose any version ever published by the Free Software
        Foundation.
      </para>

      <para>
        14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other
        free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible
        with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For
        software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
        write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
        exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two
        goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our
        free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software
        generally.
      </para>

      <para>
        NO WARRANTY
      </para>

      <para>
        15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
        WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
        LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
        HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT
        WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
        BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
        AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
        QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
        LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
        SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
      </para>

      <para>
        16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO
        IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
        MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
        LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
        INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
        INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS
        OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
        YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH
        ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN

        or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this
        License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source
        Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the
        terms of this License or a future version of this License
        released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this
        License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You
        may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version
        that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License
        or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an
        additional document offering the additional rights described in
        Section 3.5.
      </para>

      <para>
        3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You
        create or to which You contribute must be made available in
        Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the
        same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
        Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
        Executable version available; and if made available via
        Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at
        least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became
        available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version
        of that particular Modification has been made available to such
        recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source
        Code version remains available even if the Electronic
        Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
      </para>

      <para>
        3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered
        Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the

        Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
        Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of
        the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any
        notice in an Executable version or related documentation in
        which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

      <para>
        3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
      </para>

      <para>
        (a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a
        license under a third party's intellectual property rights is
        required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor
        under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file
        with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes
        the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail
        that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor
        obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available
        as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify
        the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
        thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
        appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated
        to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge
        has been obtained.
      </para>

      <para>
        (b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an
        application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge
        of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement
        that API, Contributor must also include this information in the
        LEGAL file.
      </para>

      <para>
        3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit
        A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put
        such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its
        structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such
        as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look
        for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s)
        You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described
        in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any
        documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients'
        rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may
        choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
        Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf,
        and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
        You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
        support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You
        alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
        and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
        Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability terms You offer.
      </para>

      <para>
        3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute
        Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of
        Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You
        include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the
        Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
        including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
        obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously
        included in any notice in an Executable version, related
        documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'
        rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
        Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a
        license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
        this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms
        of this License and that the license for the Executable version
        does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the
        Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License.
        If You distribute the Executable version under a different
        license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which
        differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the
        Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to
        indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
        liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor
        as a result of any such terms You offer.
      </para>

      <para>
        3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining
        Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this
        License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In
        such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License
        are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
      </para>

      <para>
        4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.If it is
        impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
        License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
        statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply
        with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible;
        and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such
        description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
        Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the
        Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or
        regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
        recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
      </para>

      <para>
        5. Application of this License. This License applies to code to
        which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A

        License from time to time. Each version will be given a
        distinguishing version number.
      </para>

      <para>
        6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been
        published under a particular version of the License, You may
        always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You
        may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any
        subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
        other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable
        to Covered Code created under this License.
      </para>

      <para>
        6.3. Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version
        of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to
        code which is not already Covered Code governed by this
        License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases
        "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or any
        confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except
        to note that your license differs from this License) and (b)
        otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
        contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
        Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
        Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described
        in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
        modifications of this License.)

        CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL
        DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY
        NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF

        terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein
        and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of
        the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are
        properly granted shall survive any termination of this License.
        Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond
        the termination of this License shall survive.

        referred to as "Participant") alleging that:
      </para>

      <para>
        (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
        indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted
        by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
        License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
        prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice
        You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually
        agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of
        Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your
        litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against
        such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable
        royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in
        writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn,
        the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1
        and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60
        day notice period specified above.

      <para>
        (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such

        effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,
        distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
        Participant.
      </para>

      <para>
        8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against
        Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version
        directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is
        resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the
        initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the
        reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant
        under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in
        determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

        AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY
        SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
        THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR
        DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE
        TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME
        JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
        INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
        LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

        be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
        This License shall be governed by California law provisions
        (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides
        otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With
        respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
        or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the
        United States of America, any litigation relating to this
        License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal
        Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying
        in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party
        responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs
        and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of
        the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International

        The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute
        are governed by the terms of this License, including without
        limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code
        may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a
        future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and
        You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the
        Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any
        terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the
        applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights
        hereunder. However, You may include an additional document

      <para>
        You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to
        contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that
        Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a
        prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly
        or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial
        Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a)
        the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version
        or related documentation in which You describe the origin or
        ownership of the Covered Code.

      <para>
        3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.
      </para>

      <para>
        (a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a
        license under a third party's intellectual property rights is
        required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor
        under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file
        with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes
        the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail
        that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor
        obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available
        as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify
        the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
        thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
        appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated
        to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge
        has been obtained.
      </para>

      <para>
        (b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an
        application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge
        of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement
        that API, Contributor must also include this information in the
        LEGAL file.
      </para>

      <para>
        (c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as
        disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes
        that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original
        creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant
        the rights conveyed by this License.
      </para>

      <para>
        3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit
        A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put
        such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its
        structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such
        as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look
        for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s)
        You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described
        in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any
        documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients'
        rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may
        choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
        Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf,
        and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.

        3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute
        Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of
        Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code. You may
        distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership
        rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
        different from this License, provided that You are in compliance
        with the terms of this License and that the license for the
        Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the
        recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights
        set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
        version under a different license You must make it absolutely
        clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered
        by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
        If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code as
        part of a product, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in
        the documentation and/or other materials provided with the
        product.

        such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License
        are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

        If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of
        this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due
        to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a)
        comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent
        possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they
        affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file
        described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all
        distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent
        prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
        sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be
        able to understand it.

        Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License.

        If You create or use a modified version of this License (which
        you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not
        already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a)
        rename Your license so that the phrase "gSOAP" or any
        confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except
        to note that your license differs from this License) and (b)
        otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
        contains terms which differ from the gSOAP Public License.

        A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
        ==========================
      </para>

      <para>
        Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at
        Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in
        the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido
        remains Python's principal author, although it includes many
        contributions from others.
      </para>

      <para>
        In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation
        for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see
        http://www.cnri.reston.va.us) in Reston, Virginia where
        he released several versions of the software.
      </para>

      <para>
        In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
        BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of
        the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations,
        which became Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software
        Foundation (PSF, see https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
        non-profit organization created specifically to own
        Python-related Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation was a
        sponsoring member of the PSF.
      </para>

      <para>
        All Python releases are Open Source (see
        http://www.opensource.org for the Open Source Definition).
        Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also been
        GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.

        (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python
        under the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you
        distribute a modified version without making your changes open
        source.  The GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine
        Python with other software that is released under the GPL; the
        others don't.

      <para>
        (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
        because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
        CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that
        1.6.1 is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

      <para>
        Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
        &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt; Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute
        verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not
        allowed.
      </para>

      <para>
        Preamble
      </para>

      <para>
        The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
        software and other kinds of works.
      </para>

      <para>
        The licenses for most software and other practical works are
        designed to take away your freedom to share and change the
        works.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended
        to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a
        program--to make sure it remains free software for all its
        users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General
        Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any
        other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it
        to your programs, too.
      </para>

      <para>
        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
        price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure
        that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software
        (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code
        or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software
        or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you
        can do these things.
      </para>

      <para>
        To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying
        you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.
        Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute
        copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to
        respect the freedom of others.
      </para>

      <para>
        For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
        gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
        freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too,
        receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them
        these terms so they know their rights.
      </para>

      <para>
        Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two
        steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you
        this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute
        and/or modify it.
      </para>

      <para>
        For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly
        explains that there is no warranty for this free software.  For
        both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified
        versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not
        be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.
      </para>

      <para>
        Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
        modified versions of the software inside them, although the
        manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with
        the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.
        The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of
        products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is
        most unacceptable.  Therefore, we have designed this version of
        the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products.  If such
        problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to
        extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the
        GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
      </para>

      <para>
        Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software
        patents.  States should not allow patents to restrict
        development and use of software on general-purpose computers,
        but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that
        patents applied to a free program could make it effectively
        proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents
        cannot be used to render the program non-free.
      </para>

        The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
        modification follow.

        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      </para>

      <para>
        0. Definitions.
      </para>

      <para>
        "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
        License.
      </para>

      <para>
        "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
        kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.
      </para>

      <para>
        "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under
        this License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees"
        and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
      </para>

      <para>
        To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of
        the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than
        the making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a
        "modified version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the
        earlier work.
      </para>

      <para>
        A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work
        based on the Program.
      </para>

      <para>
        To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
        permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
        infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it
        on a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes
        copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
        available to the public, and in some countries other activities
        as well.
      </para>

      <para>
        To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables
        other parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with
        a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy,
        is not conveying.
      </para>

      <para>
        An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal
        Notices" to the extent that it includes a convenient and
        prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate
        copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no
        warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are
        provided), that licensees may convey the work under this
        License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If the
        interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
        menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
      </para>

      <para>
        1. Source Code.
      </para>

      <para>
        The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the
        work for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any
        non-source form of a work.
      </para>

      <para>
        A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an
        official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in
        the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming
        language, one that is widely used among developers working in
        that language.
      </para>

      <para>
        The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything,
        other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the
        normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not
        part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use
        of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a
        Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to
        the public in source code form.  A "Major Component", in this
        context, means a major essential component (kernel, window
        system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on
        which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce
        the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
      </para>

      <para>
        The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means
        all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an
        executable work) run the object code and to modify the work,
        including scripts to control those activities.  However, it does
        not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose
        tools or generally available free programs which are used
        unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part
        of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes
        interface definition files associated with source files for the
        work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
        linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to
        require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow
        between those subprograms and other parts of the work.
      </para>

      <para>
        The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
        can regenerate automatically from other parts of the
        Corresponding Source.
      </para>

      <para>
        The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
        same work.
      </para>

      <para>
        2. Basic Permissions.
      </para>

      <para>
        All rights granted under this License are granted for the term
        of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the
        stated conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your
        unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output
        from running a covered work is covered by this License only if
        the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This
        License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other
        equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
      </para>

      <para>
        You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
        convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise
        remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for
        the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively
        for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,
        provided that you comply with the terms of this License in
        conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.
        Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do
        so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control,
        on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
        copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
      </para>

      <para>
        Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely
        under the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed;
        section 10 makes it unnecessary.
      </para>

      <para>
        3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
      </para>

      <para>
        No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective
        technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling
        obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty
        adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or
        restricting circumvention of such measures.
      </para>

      <para>
        When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to
        forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent
        such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this
        License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any
        intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a
        means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third
        parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological
        measures.
      </para>

      <para>
        4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
      </para>

      <para>
        You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
        you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
        and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright
        notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and
        any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to
        the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any
        warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along
        with the Program.
      </para>

      <para>
        You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you
        convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a
        fee.
      </para>

      <para>
        5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
      </para>

      <para>
        You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications
        to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under
        the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
        conditions:
      </para>

      <para>
        a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you
        modified it, and giving a relevant date.
      </para>

      <para>
        b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
        released under this License and any conditions added under
        section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section
        4 to "keep intact all notices".
      </para>

      <para>
        c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
        License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
        License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section
        7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
        regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
        permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
        invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
      </para>

      <para>
        d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must
        display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has
        interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal
        Notices, your work need not make them do so.
      </para>

      <para>
        A compilation of a covered work with other separate and
        independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of
        the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to
        form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or
        distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation
        and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or
        legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the
        individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an
        aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
        parts of the aggregate.
      </para>

      <para>
        6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
      </para>

      <para>
        You may convey a covered work in object code form under the
        terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
        machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
        License, in one of these ways:
      </para>

      <para>
        a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
        (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
        Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
        customarily used for software interchange.
      </para>

      <para>
        b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
        (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
        written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
        long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
        product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
        either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
        software in the product that is covered by this License, on a
        durable physical medium customarily used for software
        interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of
        physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to
        copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no
        charge.
      </para>

      <para>
        c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of
        the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
        alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially,
        and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in
        accord with subsection 6b.
      </para>

      <para>
        d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
        place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to
        the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place
        at no further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy
        the Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the
        place to copy the object code is a network server, the
        Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by
        you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying
        facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the
        object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
        Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you
        remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as
        needed to satisfy these requirements.
      </para>

      <para>
        e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
        provided you inform other peers where the object code and
        Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the
        general public at no charge under subsection 6d.
      </para>

      <para>
        A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
        excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need
        not be included in conveying the object code work.
      </para>

      <para>
        A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means
        any tangible personal property which is normally used for
        personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything
        designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.  In
        determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful
        cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
        product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to
        a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of
        the status of the particular user or of the way in which the
        particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use,
        the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of
        whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or
        non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only
        significant mode of use of the product.
      </para>

      <para>
        "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
        procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
        install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that
        User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding
        Source.  The information must suffice to ensure that the
        continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case
        prevented or interfered with solely because modification has
        been made.
      </para>

      <para>
        If you convey an object code work under this section in, or
        with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the
        conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of
        possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the
        recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how
        the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source
        conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the
        Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
        if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to
        install modified object code on the User Product (for example,
        the work has been installed in ROM).
      </para>

      <para>
        The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
        include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
        warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or
        installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it
        has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be
        denied when the modification itself materially and adversely
        affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
        protocols for communication across the network.
      </para>

      <para>
        Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
        provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that
        is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to
        the public in source code form), and must require no special
        password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.
      </para>

      <para>
        7. Additional Terms.
      </para>

      <para>
        "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of
        this License by making exceptions from one or more of its
        conditions.  Additional permissions that are applicable to the
        entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in
        this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable
        law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the
        Program, that part may be used separately under those
        permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this
        License without regard to the additional permissions.
      </para>

      <para>
        When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
        remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any
        part of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require
        their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)
        You may place additional permissions on material, added by you
        to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate
        copyright permission.
      </para>

      <para>
        Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for
        material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by
        the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of
        this License with terms:
      </para>

      <para>
        a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from
        the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
      </para>

      <para>
        b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices
        or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate
        Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or
      </para>

      <para>
        c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
        or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked
        in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
      </para>

      <para>
        d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors
        or authors of the material; or
      </para>

      <para>
        e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
        trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
      </para>

      <para>
        f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
        material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
        versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the
        recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions
        directly impose on those licensors and authors.
      </para>

      <para>
        All other non-permissive additional terms are considered
        "further restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the
        Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice
        stating that it is governed by this License along with a term
        that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.  If a
        license document contains a further restriction but permits
        relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a
        covered work material governed by the terms of that license
        document, provided that the further restriction does not survive
        such relicensing or conveying.
      </para>

      <para>
        If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section,
        you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
        additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice
        indicating where to find the applicable terms.
      </para>

      <para>
        Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in
        the form of a separately written license, or stated as
        exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.
      </para>

      <para>
        8. Termination.
      </para>

      <para>
        You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as
        expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to
        propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate
        your rights under this License (including any patent licenses
        granted under the third paragraph of section 11).
      </para>

      <para>
        However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
        license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
        provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
        and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
        copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
        reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
      </para>

      <para>
        Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
        reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of
        the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time
        you have received notice of violation of this License (for any
        work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation
        prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
      </para>

      <para>
        Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
        the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
        you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
        not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new
        licenses for the same material under section 10.
      </para>

      <para>
        9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
      </para>

      <para>
        You are not required to accept this License in order to receive
        or run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a
        covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using
        peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not
        require acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License
        grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.
        These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this
        License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work,
        you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
      </para>

      <para>
        10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
      </para>

      <para>
        Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
        receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify
        and propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not
        responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
        License.
      </para>

      <para>
        An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of
        an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or
        subdividing an organization, or merging organizations.  If
        propagation of a covered work results from an entity
        transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy
        of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the
        party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the
        previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
        Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in
        interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with
        reasonable efforts.
      </para>

      <para>
        You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of
        the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example,
        you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for
        exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not
        initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in
        a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by
        making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the
        Program or any portion of it.
      </para>

      <para>
        11. Patents.
      </para>

      <para>
        A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under
        this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is
        based.  The work thus licensed is called the contributor's
        "contributor version".
      </para>

      <para>
        A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
        owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired
        or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner,
        permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its
        contributor version, but do not include claims that would be
        infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the
        contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, "control"
        includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
        consistent with the requirements of this License.
      </para>

      <para>
        Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
        royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential
        patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and
        otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its
        contributor version.
      </para>

      <para>
        In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any
        express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
        enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a
        patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To
        "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make such an
        agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the
        party.
      </para>

      <para>
        If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent
        license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not
        available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms
        of this License, through a publicly available network server or
        other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause
        the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to
        deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this
        particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the
        requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to
        downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
        actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your
        conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use
        of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more
        identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to
        believe are valid.
      </para>

      <para>
        If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
        arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance
        of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the
        parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,
        propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,
        then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to
        all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.
      </para>

      <para>
        A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include
        within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or
        is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights
        that are specifically granted under this License.  You may not
        convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with
        a third party that is in the business of distributing software,
        under which you make payment to the third party based on the
        extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which
        the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive
        the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a)
        in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you
        (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in
        connection with specific products or compilations that contain
        the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or
        that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
      </para>

      <para>
        Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or
        limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement
        that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent
        law.
      </para>

      <para>
        12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
      </para>

      <para>
        If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
        agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
        License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
        License.  If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy
        simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
        pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey
        it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
        to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom
        you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both
        those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from
        conveying the Program.
      </para>

      <para>
        13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
      </para>

      <para>
        Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
        permission to link or combine any covered work with a work
        licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
        License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting
        work.  The terms of this License will continue to apply to the
        part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of
        the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning
        interaction through a network will apply to the combination as
        such.
      </para>

      <para>
        14. Revised Versions of this License.
      </para>

      <para>
        The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
        versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.
        Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
        version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
        concerns.
      </para>

      <para>
        Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
        Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
        General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you
        have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
        that numbered version or of any later version published by the
        Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a
        version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose
        any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

      <para>
        If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future

        authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

        As a special exception, you may create a larger work that
        contains part or all of the Bison parser skeleton and distribute
        that work under terms of your choice, so long as that work isn't
        itself a parser generator using the skeleton or a modified
        version thereof as a parser skeleton.  Alternatively, if you
        modify or redistribute the parser skeleton itself, you may (at
        your option) remove this special exception, which will cause the
        skeleton and the resulting Bison output files to be licensed
        under the GNU General Public License without this special
        exception.

      <para>
        The WiX toolset is released under the Microsoft Reciprocal
        License (MS-RL). A reciprocal license is used to ensure that
        others who build on the effort of the WiX community give back to
        the WiX community. Specifically the license requires that fixes
        and improvements to the WiX toolset must be published using the
        same license.
      </para>

      <para>
        Sometimes the reciprocal license is incorrectly interpreted to
        also apply to bundles, packages, and custom actions built using
        the WiX toolset. The Outercurve Foundation has previously
        provided this statement below to clarify which now the .NET
        Foundation reaffirms:
      </para>

      <blockquote>
        <para>
          The WiX toolset (WiX) is licensed under the Microsoft
          Reciprocal License (MS-RL). The MS-RL governs the distribution
          of the software licensed under it, as well as derivative
          works, and incorporates the definition of a derivative work
          provided in U.S. copyright law. OuterCurve Foundation (and the
          .NET Foundation) does not view the installer packages
          generated by WiX as falling within the definition of a
          derivative work, merely because they are produced using WiX.
          Thus, the installer packages generated by WiX will normally
          fall outside the scope of the MS-RL, and any of your source
          code, binaries, libraries, routines or other software
          components that are incorporated in installer packages
          generated by WiX can be governed by other licensing terms.
        </para>
